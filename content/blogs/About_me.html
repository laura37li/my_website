<p>My previous work experiences ranging from consulting to investment research have offered me exposure to a multitude of tasks. This enforced my ability of problem-solving and growing with a steep learning curve.
I am independently motivated, yet I appreciate team efforts and communication within a team. My extensive volunteer experience has encouraged me to work well with a diverse background group and improved my communication skills.</p>

<h2>Volunteer and Chairty</h2>
<p>As a passionate person who keep jumping out of the comfort zone to explore various possibilities, I proactively got involved in volunteer work as well. My experience in <strong>ABC</strong> <em>(A Better Community)</em> which is a non-profit consulting firm targeting at NGOs engaged me in a diverse background group that generated social impact through cooperation. We tried to study significant and valuable <strong>youth competencies</strong> in NGOs, so that some instrutive guidance can be drawn to help with NGOs’ recruitment.</p>
<p>As a volunteer consultant, I participated in expert interviews with HRs from various industries and exchange critical information with the team along with the progress of the project to keep on track, which received positive feedback from my project managers.</p>
<p>I also participated in the Blue Envelope Project initiated by my alumni which is to help left behind children in Chinese rural area grow up mentally healthy. I communicated with a child for one and a half years through hand-written letters. This experience give me chance to reflect on the importance of accompany in one’s childhood and adolescence, and how can we help children around us grow healthy.</p>
